- In this project, you will gave a dataset of stock_movement, denoted by y.
- Anothers columns be the dependent variables which be divided into 4 groups of 15 features:
        Group 1. Ask_Size
        Group 2. Bid_Size
        Group 3. Ask_Rate
        Group 4. Bid_Rate
- This problem is about the time-series forecasting; and unfortunately, we didn't have any infomation on the time-index.
- I had suggested some method to predict the value y; such as XGB, LSTM,...
